# Function Exercies
_NOTE:_ I am not asking for a specific ES syntax, but please note that you need to be able to do both.

1. What will the following code log? Why?
  ```js
let greeting = 'hi'

function hello(){
  greeting = 'bye'
}

hello()
console.log(greeting)

  ```

 2. Write a function that returns the largest of two numbers. If they are equal, return the second one.

 3. Write a function named getDogAge that takes one argument: a dog's age in human years. The function returns the dog's age in dog years. The conversion rate is 1 human year to 7 dog years.

    * Call the function and log the result.

4. Create two functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions [here](http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm)

  * Create a function called calcCircumfrence that takes the radius as an argument and return the circumference. Call the function and log the circumference:

  * Create a function called calcArea that takes the radius as an argument and returns the area.

Create a third function circleProps that takes the radius as an argument, calls the two other functions, and logs the area and circumference. The output should look like this:

"The circumference is ___".

 "The area is ___".

5. Make a temperature converter. Use google to find the conversion formulas.

  * Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns it in Fahrenheit.
  * Create a function called fahrenheitToCelcius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns it in Celsius.
  * Create a function called convertTemperature that takes two arguments: a temperature and a string. If the string is 'C', use fahrenheitToCelcius to return the temperature to Celsius. If the string is 'F', use celciusToFahrenheit to convert the temperature to Fahrenheit.

6. The Calculator:

  * Write a function `square` that returns the square of a number.
  * Write a function `half` that returns half the value of a number.
  * Write a function `percentOf` that takes two numbers. Calculate what percent the first number is of the second number, and return the result as a string. For example, 2 is 50% precent of 4, so the function returns '50%'.
  * Write a function called `areaOfCircle` that takes one argument (the radius), and return the area of a circle with that radius.
  * Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
  * Write a function doStuff that takes one argument (a number) and does the following (using the functions you wrote earlier):
      1. Calculates and saves the square of the number.
      2. Calculates and saves half the value of the result of #1.
      3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
      4. Calculate and returns the percentage the squared result (#1) is of the area (#3)

7. Write a function `arraySum` that takes in one argument and returns the sum of all the elements.
